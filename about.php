                <p>
                    We are Dennis and Sandy Owens, the new owners of Cindy’s in Freeport, Maine. You may know us as the
                    previous
                    owners of Day’s Crabmeat & Lobster. We both worked at Day’s for more than 32 years. We sold the
                    business
                    in
                    2018 and had an opportunity to purchase Cindy’s in 2019. We both wanted to simplify and downsize our
                    lives
                    and no longer operate a retail seafood store. Cindy’s was established in 1980, and we are excited at
                    the
                    opportunity to give this historic restaurant a new life. We have always taken pride in offering our
                    customers the highest quality, freshest seafood. We will continue our tradition of fresh picked
                    lobstermeat
                    and crabmeat for our rolls and wraps. We believe you can taste the quality ingredients in all our
                    menu
                    items. Come satisfy your seafood cravings at Cindy’s this season!</p>
